# Proof Checking Euclid

This repository is an attempt to understand

```
Beeson, Michael, et al. ‘Proof-Checking Euclid’. Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, vol. 85, no. 2–4, Apr. 2019, pp. 213–57. DOI.org (Crossref), https://doi.org/10.1007/s10472-018-9606-x.
```

and https://github.com/GeoCoq/GeoCoq specifically.

Most of the code here is a direct translation but with the following changes:

* Custom tactics are not used.
* `auto` tactic and the like are not used.

The goal is to be able to follow how the proof unfolds.

## Reading order

Each lemma has a tree of dependencies,
and so the dependencies need to be introduced in a particular order.

001. [euclidean_axioms](./euclidean_axioms.v)
001. [lemma_localextension](./lemma_localextension.v)
     ([img](./lemma_localextension.svg))

## How images were generated

1. Diagrams were built by hand in
   [GeoGebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) .
1. Downloaded as SVG.
1. Clipped with
   [Inkscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape) .
1. Cleaned up with [format_geogebra_svg.sh](./format_geogebra_svg.sh) .

GeoGebra is used as a way of enforcing straightedge-and-compass construction.
