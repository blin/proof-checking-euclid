# Proof Checking Euclid

This repository is an attempt to understand

Beeson, Michael, et al. ‘Proof-Checking Euclid’. Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, vol. 85, no. 2–4, Apr. 2019, pp. 213–57. DOI.org (Crossref), https://doi.org/10.1007/s10472-018-9606-x.
```

and https://github.com/GeoCoq/GeoCoq specifically.

Most of the code here is a direct translation but with the following changes:

* Custom tactics are not used.
* `auto` tactic and the like are not used.

The goal is to be able to follow how the proof unfolds.
